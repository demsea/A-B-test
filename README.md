## *A/B Testing for Home-page Optimization*



**Overview** This project was an A/B test conducted for a theoretical, non-existing company to analyze the impact of button color and text variations on the click-through rate (CTR) of a call-to-action button. The original version of the webpage featured a "Shop Now" button, which had a CTR of only 2%. The goal was to determine whether changes in the buttonâ€™s color or text would lead to an increase in CTR.

**Experiment Setup**:

Four versions of the webpage were tested.

The primary metric for evaluation was CTR. While other metrics were considered relevant, statistical significance in CTR was the key determinant for selecting the superior version. The test was conducted over 14 days to cover two complete business cycles.

**Hypotheses**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: All versions have the same CTR.
-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: At least one version has a different CTR.

A standard statistical significance level of 95% was chosen, with a minimum detectable effect (MDE) of 20%, ensuring that even a small improvement would justify implementing a website change.

**Analysis and Results** Since multiple versions were tested, a Chi-square test was conducted. The results led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that at least one version performed significantly better or worse than the others. To pinpoint the best-performing version, post hoc tests were conducted to compare each version pairwise.

The results showed that:

-   **Version C had the highest CTR** and exhibited a statistically significant difference compared to Versions B and D.
-   **Version A had the second-highest CTR** and was not significantly different from Version C.
-   Since Version A and Version C both performed well and were not significantly different from each other, it was challenging to declare a single definitive winner.

**Conclusions and Next Steps** While Versions A and C emerged as the top-performing variations, determining the best version requires further analysis beyond statistical tests. Additional considerations include:

-   Evaluating other metrics alongside CTR.
-   Incorporating qualitative research (e.g., user feedback).
-   Consulting subject-matter experts.
-   Redesigning and conducting further experiments.

By integrating these additional steps, a more data-driven and business-oriented decision can be made regarding which version should be permanently featured on the website.
